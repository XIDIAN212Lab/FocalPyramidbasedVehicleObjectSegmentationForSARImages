# FocalPyramidbasedVehicleObjectSegmentationForSARImages
dataset for paper 'Focal Pyramid based Vehicle Object Segmentation for SAR Images'

Due to the lack of open-source vehicle object segmentation dataset, We relabeled the vehicle objects in MSTAR images at the pixel level to produce vehicle object slices.
